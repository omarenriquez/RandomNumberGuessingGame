<a id="about-the-project" class="anchor" href="#about-the-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About The Project.</h3>

<p>This was a personal project, in order to challenge myself and apply what I am learning in class I have taken the initiative to come up with my own projects that challenge both in a creative and technical sense. For this project I decided to make a game in Visual Basic Community, using windows form application. It was a random number guessing game that gave feedback to the user and also presented useful information that would help the user get closer to the answer.</p>

<a id="program-requirements" class="anchor" href="#program-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Program Requirements</h3>

<p>For this project I decided that the program would generate a random number from 1 - 100 and ask the user for a guess.</p>

<p>When the user enters a guess, program tells the user:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the random number generated by the program is LOWER or HIGHER than their guess.</li>
<li>If the number is odd or even to help them narrow down their options</li>
<li>The attempt count is presented to the user and increases by 1 every time the user enters a guess.</li>
<li>Game resets and start over with a new randomly generated number when the user presses the "Start Over" button. </li>
</ul>

<a id="what-i-learned" class="anchor" href="#what-i-learned" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I Learned</h3>

<p>I learned how to take the initiative and come up with something all by myself, no direction from professors. I also learned how to reset the application and how to generate random numbers via the C# language. I am continuously trying to improve the project and will keep adding new features that make the program interesting such as adding rounds, and points depending on the number of attempts the user enters.</p>
